# RectangleDemo

## Description
This Java project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts using a `Rectangle` class that models a rectangle with attributes such as length, width, and color. The program includes a `RectangleDemo` class that creates and manipulates `Rectangle` objects. It also demonstrates how to pass objects as arguments to methods and retrieve their attributes.

## Author
Written by Mohammed Qutu.

## Requirements
- Java 21.0.2 or later

## Usage
To run the program, compile the `RectangleDemo.java` and `Rectangle.java` files, then execute the `RectangleDemo` class. The program will create a `Rectangle` object and display its attributes, such as length, width, and color.

### Example Output
The length of the rectangle is: 20.0 The width of the rectangle is: 15.0 The color of the rectangle is: red This rectangle has a length of 20.0

### Key Features:
- **`Rectangle` Class**: Represents a rectangle with attributes like length, width, and color.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the rectangle with given dimensions and color.
- **Getters and Setters**: Provides methods to retrieve and update the rectangle's attributes.
- **Method with Object Parameter**: Demonstrates how to pass a `Rectangle` object as a parameter to a method.

### Methods:
- **Rectangle Class**:
  - `getLength()`, `getWidth()`, `getColor()`: Retrieves the length, width, and color of the rectangle.
  - `setLength()`, `setWidth()`, `setColor()`: Updates the length, width, and color of the rectangle.
  - `showsides(Rectangle s)`: Demonstrates passing objects to methods by printing the rectangle's length.
